  Generate a integer between `low` and `high`

  Uses Rust's [rand::ThreadRng](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/rngs/struct.ThreadRng.html)
  which is a struct that uses ChaCha12 for generating random numbers and operating systemâ€™s random number source
  for seeding. Also automatically reseeds after a specific amount of bytes. Check their documentation for more details.

  iex> large_integer = round(:math.pow(2, 64))
  ...> low = -large_integer
  ...> high = large_integer
  ...> RustyCrypt.Random.uniform(low, high) in low..high
